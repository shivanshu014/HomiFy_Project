Why MongoDB Instead of SQL?
Schema Flexibility

MongoDB is a document-based database, meaning it does not require a fixed schema like SQL databases.
Your Listing schema contains embedded objects like image, reviews, and geometry, which fits well with MongoDB's flexible JSON-like BSON format.
If requirements change, you can easily add or remove fields without altering the entire schema.
One-to-Many Relationships Handling

You have used an array of references (reviews: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Review" }]) to handle one-to-many relationships efficiently.
In SQL, this would require JOIN operations, which can slow down performance when dealing with large datasets.
Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)

MongoDB scales horizontally using sharding, meaning it can handle a large number of users and data more efficiently compared to SQL databases that rely on vertical scaling.
Ideal for applications like Homify, where there might be a large number of property listings and reviews.
Better Performance for Read-Heavy Applications

Denormalized data (storing related data together in a document) reduces the number of queries needed.
In SQL, fetching a listing along with its reviews would require JOIN operations, which can be expensive in terms of performance.
GeoSpatial Queries (Ideal for Location-Based Services)

Your Listing schema includes a geometry field with coordinates.
MongoDB has native support for geospatial indexing and queries, making it perfect for location-based applications like Homify.
SQL databases require additional GIS extensions for similar functionality, which can be complex to implement.
Easier Integration with JavaScript (MERN Stack Compatibility)

Since MongoDB stores data in JSON-like format (BSON), it integrates seamlessly with JavaScript and Node.js, which powers your backend.
SQL databases require ORMs (like Sequelize or TypeORM), adding extra complexity.
When Would SQL Be a Better Choice?
If your data has strong relationships with many constraints (e.g., banking systems, e-commerce transactions).
If you need complex queries with ACID transactions (though MongoDB now supports multi-document transactions).
If you want strict data validation and normalization to avoid duplicate or inconsistent data.
Final Answer to the Interviewer
"I chose MongoDB because it provides schema flexibility, efficient one-to-many relationship handling, horizontal scalability, 
and built-in geospatial support. Given that my application deals with real estate listings, reviews, and user-generated data, 
a NoSQL approach allows me to store data in a way that mirrors how it's used in the application, reducing the need for complex
 JOINs and improving performance. Additionally, MongoDB's compatibility with JavaScript and Node.js makes development smoother
  in a MERN stack project."
